I ain't got much to talk about this, most of the code is his and I changed them according to my specifications.
I used this a toy problem to get started with DNN.

To use it, just run the test_model.py (link to a trained model : ), and don't forget to change the dimensions according to your window size.
After cleaning data, the valid data samples are around 22k and the accuracy of the model is 67% (not so bad !!)
