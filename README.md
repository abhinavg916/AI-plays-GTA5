* I ain't got much to talk about this, most of the code is his and I changed them according to my specifications.
* I used this as a toy problem to get started with DNN.

* To use it, just run the test_model.py (link to a trained model : https://drive.google.com/open?id=15Z0CiZpWzLaEwCIfYY6sqKGBWAvpyD1l ), and don't forget to change the dimensions according to your window size.
* After cleaning data, the valid data samples are around 22k and the accuracy of the model is 67% (not so bad !!)
